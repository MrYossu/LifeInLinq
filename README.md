# Life in Linq

My attempt to code John H. Conway's Game of Life in Linq, or at least, in as much Linq as possible.

There is a bit of a story behind why I decided to try this, which I rambled on about in a [blog post](https://www.pixata.co.uk](https://www.pixata.co.uk/2024/07/08/implementing-conways-game-of-life-in-linq/).

This is the sample code for the blog post.
