# Life in Linq

My attempt to code John H. Conway's Game of Life in Linq, or at least, in as much Linq as possible.

Why? Why not! ðŸ˜Ž

Actually, there is a bit of a story behind why I decided to try this, but I ahven't time to type it up yet. When/if I get the code working, I'll probably add a [blog post](https://www.pixata.co.uk) with more details. But don't hold your breath!
